# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Full Chinese localization (全面汉化)** — All UI strings translated to Chinese: categories, buttons, labels, help overlay, confirm dialog, status bar, progress messages. The 14 cleanable categories now display as 项目、调试日志、文件历史、遥测数据、Shell 快照、插件、会话记录、待办事项、计划、使用数据、任务、剪贴板缓存、配置备份、历史记录. Time formats localized to X天前/X小时前/刚刚.
- New `src/i18n.rs` module with comprehensive Chinese translation mappings for all UI strings

### Changed

- All category names, screen titles, button labels, status messages, and help text now render in Chinese by default
- Time/age formatting uses Chinese units (天/月/年/小时)
- Yes/No settings display as 是/否

### Fixed

- Clippy warnings from Rust 1.95 (re-applied from 0.1.1)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Project summary statistics (orphan/active counts) now reflect the filtered result set when a search/filter is active, matching what is displayed in the Projects tab and the Preview tab (#1, #2)
- Summary now shows `filtered/total` project count when a filter is active, so the relationship between visible rows and full scan is obvious
- Clippy warnings introduced by Rust 1.95 — `sort_by` replaced with `sort_by_key(Reverse)`; nested `if` blocks inside `match` arms folded into match guards

### Changed

- `Selected` count in the projects summary stays global (across all projects), independent of the current filter, to avoid surprising changes when the search box is edited
- Filtered project lookup uses `filter_map(.get())` instead of direct indexing for defensive safety

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **5-screen TUI workflow**: Dashboard → Select → Projects → Preview → Clean
- **Dashboard**: Auto-scan on startup with per-category size/file breakdown and usage bars
- **Select screen**: Unified 3-section interface combining category selection, config JSON cleanup options, and settings (expiry threshold, dry run)
- **Category scanning**: 14 cleanable categories — Projects, Debug Logs, File History, Telemetry, Shell Snapshots, Plugins, Transcripts, Todos, Plans, Usage Data, Tasks, Paste Cache, Config Backups, History
- **Project browser**: Browse all projects with orphan (ORPHAN) vs active status, search/filter, bulk select
- **Orphan project detection**: Identifies project caches where the original path no longer exists
- **Expiry-based filtering**: Per-file age tracking with configurable threshold; file counts and sizes update dynamically as threshold changes
- **Active project cleaning**: For non-orphan projects, only files older than the expiry threshold are deleted (not the entire directory)
- **Surgical `~/.claude.json` cleanup**: Remove orphan project entries, session metrics, and stale cache keys without deleting the file; uses atomic writes
- **3-segment preview bar**: Green (will clean), yellow (matchable but unselected), red (not matched/kept)
- **Progress bar**: Real-time progress tracking during cleaning with percentage, freed/expected sizes, and per-category log
- **Persistent preferences**: Settings and selections saved to `~/.claude/cleaner-preferences.json` after each clean, auto-loaded on next startup
- **Dry run mode**: Simulate cleaning without deleting any files
- **Protected paths**: `settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `ide/`, `credentials.json` are never touched
- **History trimming**: `history.jsonl` is trimmed to last 500 lines (not deleted)
- **Config backup cleanup**: Detects `~/.claude.json.backup*` files in home directory
- **Event batching**: Coalesces rapid input events to prevent UI freeze during fast scrolling
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard-driven interface with vi-style keys, number keys for screen jumping, search/filter in project list
- **Help overlay**: Press `?` for context-sensitive help
- **Confirm dialog**: Safety confirmation before executing clean
